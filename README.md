## üíæ Installation <a id="installation"></a>

Deployed on [Render](https://noteworthy-k2jj.onrender.com/)

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage <a id="usage"></a>


Visit the deployed site [**here**](https://noteworthy-k2jj.onrender.com/)

On the landing page, click **Get Started**  to take you to the note page. There you can see saved notes and have an area to make a new form.

To make a new note, enter in a title and some text for the note. While filling out the form, **Save Note** and **Clear Form** buttons will appear. If you are happy with your note input, click Save. If you would like to just start over, hit that Clear.

To take a look at the details of a note, go ahead and select it by clicking on it. The full note with title and text will appear in the note form area. As that is displayed, a **New Note** button will appear. This button is for when you are done with looking at a note, and are ready to write another. It will replace the displaying note with a blank form again.

When you get too many notes, or do not need a certain note anymore, there is a trash can icon next to each note's title. When you click that, it will take care of removing that note from the page.

While writing code for routes, I used the REST Client extension in VS Code. I also used Insomnia to test some routes and their information.
